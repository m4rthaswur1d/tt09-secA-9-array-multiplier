## How it works

This is a 4x4 array muliplier that takes in two 4-bit factors, m and q, and uses a full adder to output an 8-bit product of m and q, p.

## How to test

Test the multiplier with a test bench of 10 varrying values of 4-bit factors with their multiplcation value. This is an unsigned decimal multiplier.
